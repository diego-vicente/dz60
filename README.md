# `dvm-dz60`: My personal QMK configuration

This repository contains the custom QMK configuration I use for my keyboard, a
[DZ60RGB v2 Hot Swap][1]. This configuration has been crafted using the
available [QMK configurator][2], and the included JSON can be uploaded to it in
order to compile and retrieve the binary to flash the keyboard.

This process is not as agile as I would like but I do not change this
configuration that often, so there are no plans to change this workflow in the
near future - it will remain this way until it falls short for a specific
feature I need.
